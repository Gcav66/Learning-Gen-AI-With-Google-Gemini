While notebooks are excellent for experimentation and development, directly deploying an `.ipynb` file for production training and serving is generally not recommended due to limitations in version control, dependency management, automation, scalability, and monitoring.\n",

            "*   **`model_training.py`**: Script for defining, training, and evaluating your ML model. This script should save the trained model artifact (e.g., `model.joblib`, `model.pkl`, `model.tar.gz`) to a specified output location.\n",
            "*   **`model_inference.py`**: Script containing functions for loading your trained model and performing predictions. This is crucial for your serving component. It typically includes:\n",
